Objective: The objective of this project was to develop a robust method for Copy-Move Forgery Detection in digital images using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and RANSAC algorithms. The goal was to create a technique capable of detecting forged regions even under challenges like geometric transformations (scaling, rotation), blurring, noise addition, and JPEG compression.

Results:

    Successfully implemented a forgery detection system using DWT, SIFT, and RANSAC algorithms.

    The method proved effective in detecting copy-move forgery, even in images with geometric transformations, blurring, noise, and JPEG compression.

    Demonstrated robustness against post-processing operations commonly used to hide forged regions.

    Achieved a balance between accuracy and time complexity, making the solution practical for real-world applications.
